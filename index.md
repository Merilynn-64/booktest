Open Robotics AI & Deep-Tech Initiative
Overview
Open Robotics AI & Deep-Tech Training is an open-source, hands-on initiative designed to equip learners with STEM, robotics, AI, and business development skills. Using a problem-based learning approach, it bridges theory with real-world applications, preparing participants to build, deploy, and commercialize robotics solutions. The program emphasizes both technical expertise and entrepreneurial skills, ensuring learners can innovate and scale automation technologies effectively.

What you will learn
The program covers:

STEM & Robotics Fundamentals – Physics, electronics, programming, and smart technologies.
Deep-Tech Applications – Mechatronics, Embedded systems, ROS-based systems, ML and computer vision, HMI and UI.
AI-Driven Automation – Autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), AI-powered logistics, and warehouse automation.
Industry-ready Robotics Solutions – Applications in e-commerce, logistics, and industrial automation.
Business & Entrepreneurship – Robotics commercialization and Robotics-as-a-Service (RaaS) models.
Core pillars
Training is structured around four interconnected areas:

Deep-Tech & Robotics – AI-robotics education, both theoretical and practical.
Hands-On Development – Prototyping AMRs, cobots, and AI-powered automation systems.
Prototyping & Manufacturing – Transitioning concepts into real-world production.
Business & Entrepreneurship – Turning robotics innovations into scalable commercial ventures.
Our solution
This initiative comprised of two parts: Level_1: Incubation and Level_2 Acceleraion. First part is a set of PVC educational DIY kits and second part is based on two open-source real-world projects that merge AI-driven automation with practical robotics training:

OpenAMR – Autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) for warehouse logistics and material handling.
EasyMove – AI-powered, puzzle-based rack-moving systems for smart storage and sorting (in progress...).
By integrating AMRs with intelligent storage solutions, we provide an affordable, scalable, and flexible warehouse automation framework while training professionals in deep-tech disciplines to drive innovation in robotics and AI.
