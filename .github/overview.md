# Open Robotics AI & Deep-Tech Initiative 

## Overview
Open Robotics AI & Deep-Tech Training is an open-source, hands-on initiative designed to equip learners with STEM, robotics, AI, and business development skills. Using a problem-based learning approach, it bridges theory with real-world applications, preparing participants to build, deploy, and commercialize robotics solutions. The program emphasizes both technical expertise and entrepreneurial skills, ensuring learners can innovate and scale automation technologies effectively.

## What you will learn  
The program covers:  
- **STEM & Robotics Fundamentals** – Physics, electronics, programming, and smart technologies.  
- **Deep-Tech Applications** – Mechatronics, Embedded systems, ROS-based systems, ML and computer vision, HMI and UI.  
- **AI-Driven Automation** – Autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), AI-powered logistics, and warehouse automation.  
- **Industry-ready Robotics Solutions** – Applications in e-commerce, logistics, and industrial automation.  
- **Business & Entrepreneurship** – Robotics commercialization and Robotics-as-a-Service (RaaS) models.  

## Core pillars  
Training is structured around four interconnected areas:  
1. **Deep-Tech & Robotics** – AI-robotics education, both theoretical and practical.  
2. **Hands-On Development** – Prototyping AMRs, cobots, and AI-powered automation systems.  
3. **Prototyping & Manufacturing** – Transitioning concepts into real-world production.  
4. **Business & Entrepreneurship** – Turning robotics innovations into scalable commercial ventures.  

## Our solution  
This initiative comprised of two parts: **[Level_1: Incubation](L1_Incubation/)** and **[Level_2 Acceleraion](L2_Acceleration/)**. First part is a set of PVC educational DIY kits and second part is based on **two open-source real-world projects** that merge **AI-driven automation with practical robotics training**:  
- **[OpenAMR](https://github.com/openAMRobot)** – Autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) for warehouse logistics and material handling.  
- **EasyMove** – AI-powered, puzzle-based rack-moving systems for smart storage and sorting (in progress...).  

By integrating **AMRs with intelligent storage solutions**, we provide an **affordable, scalable, and flexible** warehouse automation framework while **training professionals in deep-tech disciplines** to drive innovation in robotics and AI.  

## Who benefits?  
This program is designed for a wide range of participants, including:  

- **Aspiring Robotics & AI engineers** – Seamless learning path from school-level STEM to professional robotics and AI development.
